My first try to making games in unity (C#)

These are stupid sources that i made for my stupid game (3D First person Shooter Unity), That was my first try to make a unity game AND my first experiance to code in C#, I Didn't used anytoturials for these scripts (Just used for PlayerMovement.cs).


PlayerMovement.cs : Which helps you to move your character (Jump, Move, Gravity, Velocity).

PlayerLook.cs : Which helps you to move your character's head (Actiually its an stupid mathematics operation with Mouse vertical & Mouse horizontal) + Gun zoom feature (Right click to zoom with the guns).

Drop&Pickup.cs : Which helps you to pickup or drop a gun in your game(Dropping gravity is so stupid, just change Gravity.y to -40 in your project_settings/Gravity if you want to use this source!).

NOTE: As i said this was my first time for trying to make a game and using c# and unity engine, I just spent 3 hours to learn some basics (Like how to work with unity and...) Without using any toturials (Just used a toturial for player movements), So do not blame for codes!
